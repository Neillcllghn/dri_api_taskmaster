# TaskMaster - API
## Project Description

TaskMaster is a web based platform that allows its users to manage their tasks, based on a categories that they assign a task, what the task is in terms of giving it a title and a description, whether it is urgent or not. They can assign a due date for when they need the task to be finished by. The application consists of the React app and an API. Welcome to the Django Rest Framework API project section.

### API Documentation Sections

In this API documentation, you'll find the following sections:

- **User Stories**: The functionality of the API and how it works for the user.

- **Entity Relationship Diagram**: Illustrates the relationships between different entities for a comprehensive overview.

- **Models and CRUD breakdown**: Delve into the specifics of API endpoints, including how to create, retrieve, update, and delete data, along with filtering and text search capabilities.

- **Tests**: Understand the quality assurance measures taken to ensure the reliability and functionality of the API.

- **Deployment steps**: Learn how to deploy the API to various environments, enabling you to use it effectively in your projects.

- **Acknowledgments**: Recognition of any libraries, frameworks, or tools used in the project.

  - logged out users cannot retrieve a tasks with a valid id.
  - logged out users can't retrieve a tasks with an invalid id.
  - logged in users can update a task they own.
  - logged in users can't update a task they don't own.
  - logged in users can't create a task if all fields are blank.
  - logged in users can't create a task with a due date in the past.
 
- **Category app:**
  - logged out users cannot list categories.
  - logged in users can create a category.
  - logged out users can't create a category.
  - logged out users cannot retrieve a category with a valid id.
  - logged out users can't retrieve a category with an invalid id.
